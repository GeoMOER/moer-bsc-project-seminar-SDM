This assignment introduces you to data input and output with R and will strengthen your skills in work directory management.
<!--more-->

After completion you should be able to read in .csv files into R, process the contained data with R commands, and write out some output to your local computer. 
You will further have reinforced your skills for running commands within R scripts, for compiling documents with R markdown, and for using Git and GitHub.



## Things you need for this assignment

  * [R](https://cran.r-project.org/){:target="_blank"} — the interpreter can be installed on any operation system.
  * [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} — we recommend to use R Studio for (interactive) programming with R.
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads){:target="_blank"} environment for your operating system.
  * [The Data input and output tutorial](https://geomoer.github.io/moer-base-r/unit06/unit06-01_Intro.html){:target="_blank"} for this course.
  * A .csv file, which can be downloaded from the course server. The url will be provided by the instructor.


## Data input and output assignment

1. Work yourself through the data input and output tutorial, which you can find [here](https://geomoer.github.io/moer-base-r/unit06/unit06-01_Intro.html){:target="_blank"}
1. Download the .csv file from the course server and save it into your local data folder.

Please write an R script as an Rmd file with html output for the following tasks:

1. <span style="color:red"> Read in the data contained in this .csv file into R as an R object in the R workspace </span>
1. <span style="color:red"> Do some fancy stuff with the object. Data and object types, indexing.  </span>
1. <span style="color:red"> Do maybe some other fancy stuff with the object.  </span>

Save your Rmd file in your course repository, knitr it, update (i.e. commit) your local repository and publish (i.e. push) it to the GitHub classroom. 
Make sure that the created html file is also part of your GitHub repository.


This assignment will NOT be marked. 
Note, however, that you will be hopelessly lost in the subsequent sessions if you have neither control over your work environment nor data input and output.
