Learn the essentials for georeferencing.

Georeferencing in this course will be done with [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/){:target="_blank"}, 
which is arguably the best program for doing this job.
You will use QGIS for obtaining ground control points, which will then be fed into the Digitizer for doing the reprojection from unreferenced image space to geographical space.
