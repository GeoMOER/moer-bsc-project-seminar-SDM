Remember that all SDM approaches have a similar generic workflow, but now let us focus on the part called "Biodiversity data":

## Biodiversity data?

The most important component of "biodiversity data" for operating SDMs is information on the _occurrence of species._
In particular, it is digital raster or vector data on the spatio-temporal coordinates of species in the real word. 

Of course, there is and should be  a lot of additional information related to the occurrence of species, 
like taxonomic reference system, ecological level, 
biodiversity data sources, sampling design, sample size per taxon, country/region mask, 
details on scaling, data cleaning/filtering, absence data collection, pseudo-absence and background data, 
potential errors and biases in data (all from Zurell et al. 2020),
but the use of biodiversity data in SDM ultimately boils down to the digital numbers of coordinates of species in geographical space.

## Occurrence records

It is a long way from field sampling to feeding digital occurrence data into an SDM.
