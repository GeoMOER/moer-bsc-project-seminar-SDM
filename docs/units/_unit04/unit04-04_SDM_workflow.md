All SDM approaches have a similar generic workflow:

### Conceptualisation

Make a plan for your work first.


### Data

The butterflies of Pakistan and maybe of whole Asia - depending on the outcome of the digitization part of this course - will serve as example in this course.


### Model fitting

There are plenty of methods available for this step. 
Here are the arguably most important ones, which will be introduced by your tutorials:


| Method                           |  
|----------------------------------
|**Profile methods**               |
|Bioclim                           |
|Domain                            |
|**Regression methods**            |
|Generalized linear models         |
|Generalized additive models       |
|**Machine-learning methods**      |
|MaxEnt                            |
|Random forest                     |
|Boosted regression trees          |
|Neural networks                   |
|Support vector machines           |
|XG Boost                          |
|Bayesian nonparametric regression |
|**Ensemble methods**              |
|Model averaging                   |


### Assessment

Depends a bit on the method, but not too much.


### Predictions

Are easy to make but difficult to reproduce and even more difficult to evaluate.
