title: Applicability of SDM?
---


What can we do once the distribution of a single species or of a set of species is modelled?

There are plenty of opportunities and here are some of them:

* a species' range can be used for _descriptive purposes_ like assessing and monitoring species numbers and composition in a particular area,
* if we model the distribution from the occurrence of individuals of different steps in time, we can assess _changes of distribution ranges_ through time,
* if we know under which environmental conditions species do occur, we can predict the _suitability of habitats_ that are not occupied yet,
* with SDM, it is possible to predict the occurrence of species under scenarios of climate change, what has direct relevance for _nature conservation_,
* stacking many predicted species' distributions together allows us to calculate the number of species - or _species richness_ - that occur in a particular area or grid cell, what is directly relevant for _biodiversity research_, 
* and last but not least, knowing the distribution ranges of species allows researchers to link characteristics of species with characteristics of the environment, what opens up a plethora of possibilities in scientific research to understand better the _functional significance of traits of species_, to understand better _why species occur in some places but not in others_, and ultimately to understand a bit better the _functional and phylogenetic diversity_ of life on Earth.
