title: Why SDM?
---

Obviously, there are too many species on Earth to know them all, not to say their distribution ranges. 
To make things even more complicated, a _species_ does not exists physically but consists of _individuals_, which share characteristics according to a _species concept_.

This problem is known as the _Wallacean shortfall_ and the reason why we need SDM: we never can sample all individuals of a species (some exeptions of extremely rare species may exist, though) to know the actual distribution of a species, not to mention their dynamics through time.
