Get familiar with important references on SDM and prepare an HTML tutorial for a particular modelling technique.


## References

Start with the excellent general overviews by Robert J. Hijmans and Jane Elith on [www.rspatial.org](https://www.rspatial.org/sdm/SDM.pdf){:target="_blank"} 
and by Damaris Zurell on [damariszurell.github.io](https://damariszurell.github.io/SDM-Intro/){:target="_blank"}.


Then continue with more specific literature on particular methods, _for example_:
* [A practical guide to MaxEnt for modeling speciesâ€™ distributions: what it does, and why inputs and settings matter](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.07872.x){:target="_blank"},
* [A review of evidence about use and performance of species distribution modelling ensembles like BIOMOD](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ddi.12892){:target="_blank"}, or
* [Predicting species distribution: offering more than simple habitat models](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00792.x){:target="_blank"}.


Especially consider this reference, which can serve as a comprehensive guideline for your reproducible workflow:
[A standard protocol for reporting species distribution models](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.04960){:target="_blank"}.

Finally, get more specific by checking out the example unit with SDM tutorials created by former students 
(direct link [here]({{ "unit99/student_tutorials-01_overview.html" | absolute_url }}){:target="_blank"}.)


## Deliverables

Prepare a markdown-based HTML Tutorial for your individual SDM method and present it in the course.
Plan with 30 minutes minimum up to one hour per tutorial.
The dates for your presentations can be found in the syllabus on the [course front page]({{ "index.html" | absolute_url }}).
