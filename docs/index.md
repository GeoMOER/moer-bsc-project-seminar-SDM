Species distribution modelling (SDM) is a key competence for ecogeographical research and applied nature conservation. 
It allows researchers to estimate current distributions of species and to also predict their future distributions under climate change scenarios.
SDM encompasses various area-wide spatial predictions techniques and requires profound skills related to organizing, handling, analyzing and visualizing of geodata. 

By using the programming environment R, this course will open the door to the cosmos of SDM techniques and will provide a flexible baseline for workflow automation in real research projects. Special emphasis will be on R Markdown for proper documentation and reproducibility. 


# Intended learning outcomes
At the end of this course you should be able to

* to organize a variety of datasets and (intermediate) analysis results in structured fashion,
* to document your workflow in an understandable and transparent manner, collaborate in teams and handle issues and task management using Git and GitHub as software management tool and plattform,
* to implement data analysis workflows using tailored R scripts along with readily available functions from third-party R packages,
* to model relationships between data variables and calculate reliable error estimates,
* to critically evaluate your analysis.

# Course features

This course is intended as a blended learning module in our study program although the provided introductions, explanations and examples might be useful for self-study, too.
Given the enormous body of literature and methods available for SDM, it can only be an entry point for more sophisticated and project-specific modelling techniques.
Each course aims to create area-wide species distribution maps for a group of organisms and a particular area of the world for which hitherto no species richness maps exist.
