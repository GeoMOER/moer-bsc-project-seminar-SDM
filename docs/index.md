Species distribution modelling (SDM) is a key competence for ecogeographical research and applied nature conservation 
because it allows us to estimate the current distributions of species and to also to predict the future distributions of species under climate change scenarios.
SDM encompasses various area-wide spatial predictions techniques and requires profound skills related to organizing, handling, analyzing and visualizing of geodata. 

By using the programming environment R, this course will open the door to the cosmos of SDM techniques and will more generally provide a flexible baseline for workflow automation in real research projects.

# Intended learning outcomes
At the end of this course you should be able
  
* to organize a variety of datasets and (intermediate) analysis results in structured fashion,
* to document your workflow in an understandable and transparent manner, collaborate in teams and handle issues and task management using Git and GitHub as software management tool and plattform,
* to implement data analysis workflows using tailored R scripts along with readily available functions from third-party R packages,
* to model relationships between data variables and calculate reliable error estimates,
* to critically evaluate your analysis.

# Course features

The course provides a basis for the parallel [Geo Information Systems](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/data/UNIMR/lm_data/lm_2092236/index.html){:target="_blank"} and [Remote Sensing](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/data/UNIMR/lm_data/lm_2285471/index.html){:target="_blank"} courses. It is intended as a blended learning module in our study program although the provided introductions, explanations and examples might be useful for self-study, too.
