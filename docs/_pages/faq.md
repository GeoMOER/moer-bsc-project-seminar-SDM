## Git and GitHub

### Where can I find the url to my personal GitHub classroom repository?
Follow the link to the GitHub classroom provided by the instructor and you will find something like this:
https://github.com/GeoMOER-Students-Space/bsc-species-distribution-modelling-2021-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.git

### How can I find out if my files were properly uploaded to the GitHub repository?
Enter the url of your GitHub Classroom repository in a web browser and check if they are there.

### How can I check if the HTML files in my GitHub repository have the right content?
You can check the contents of your (HTML) files by downloading them from the remote repository to your local computer. 
Therefore, press "code" (the green button) and then "download zip" in your repository using your internet browser.
After downloading, you can open and render HTML files with your browser.


## Course requirements

### What is the expected workload for this course?
This course gives 6 (ECTS) credit points, making up a total of 180 hours workload.
180 hours in total minus the time spend during the course sessions divided by the number of weeks makes up a workload of 9.6 hours on average per week in addition to the time spend during the course sessions ((180-(13*3.5))/14). Note that this workload is intended to achieve an average grade according to the official European study system.

### Orientation

Use the examples provided [here](https://geomoer.github.io/moer-bsc-project-seminar-SDM//unit99/student_tutorials-01_overview.html) as orientation.

### Duration 

Plan with 30 minutes minimum up to one hour for each tutorial presentation.

### Test your presentation!

Check the technical requirements you need for the live-streaming of your tutorial on your local machine (e.g. audio, video, screen sharing, internet connection) **before** your presentation.

### Data

Some useful data can be found on our [course sever](http://85.214.102.111/data) in the folder "geodata".

### Grid

For creating a seamless raster map of your results, you need a grid system, which you can find on the course server. 
You may want to use the 50 km x 50 km grid system, which is a compromise between accuracy and processing time.

### General remarks

* The aim of the tutorials is to teach others how your method works and how it is applied. Special emphasis should be given to an appealing, reproducible and self-explanatory HTML page for your method.
* Technically, the result of your modelling workflow should be a map of the species numbers of butterflies in Pakistan. 
This means each cell of your grid system has as value the sum of the occurring species in this cell. So yes, you need to model all species separately and sum up the occurring species within each cell.
* Start early! This is going to be quite some work. Use the tutorials of former students as orientation.
* The student tutorial will make up 50% of overall grade.
* If live processing of your script takes too much time, use screenshots and add them to your HTML page, which should be self-explanatory anyways.
